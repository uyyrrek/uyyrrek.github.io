#### Wisconsin Retail and Wholesale Employment Forecasting

Time series forecasting is a core skill in applied statistics and economics. This project was designed to develop expertise in modeling seasonal and trend-based patterns using ARIMA and SARIMA techniques. Forecasting employment trends is critical for informing workforce planning, economic policy, and resource allocation in the public and private sectors.

Techniques Used:

- Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality)
- Log transformation and Box-Cox transformation
- Seasonal and non-seasonal differencing (∇₁∇₁₂)
- ACF/PACF plots for model identification
- SARIMA model selection using AICc
- Residual diagnostics (Ljung-Box, Shapiro-Wilk, residual ACF/PACF)
- Forecasting with confidence intervals (12-step ahead)

#### Real-Time Twitch Sentiment Analysis

Live chat platforms like Twitch present unique challenges in natural language processing due to informal language, emotes, and rapid message flow. This project serves as a practical application of streaming data pipelines, sentiment analysis, and transformer-based models in a real-time setting. It demonstrates the feasibility of deploying NLP tools for social media monitoring and audience engagement analytics.
